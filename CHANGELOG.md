This is the first public baseline release of pipt. It consolidates all prior work and sets up automated publishing.

### CI/CD
- GitHub Actions CI across Python 3.9â€“3.12 (ruff, mypy, pytest).
- Trusted Publishing (OIDC) to PyPI via `publish.yml` workflow and `pypi` environment.

### Docs
- Improved README with Quickstart, usage examples, options, and compatibility notes.
- Wider logo and absolute image URL so it renders on PyPI.
- Badges for CI and PyPI.

### Tooling

- MIT `LICENSE` added.
